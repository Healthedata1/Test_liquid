### Package File

The following package file includes an NPM package file used by many of the FHIR tools. It contains all the value sets, profiles, extensions, list of pages and URLs in the IG, etc., defined as part of this version of the Implementation Guides. This file should be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since it contains all the rules about what makes the profiles valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the specification content and profiles that apply to make a conformant implementation. For more information, see the [validating profiles and resources] documentation in FHIR.

### Requirements Table

This table lists the requirements defined in the US Core Implementation Guide's narrative sections. These requirements represent the regulatory, business, functional, and technical specifications that design artifacts must meet to ensure interoperability. They are documented here to provide a clear, consolidated reference for implementers working with this guide. This table is based in large part on the [US Core Server v8.0.0 Specification Requirements](https://inferno.healthit.gov/suites/us_core_v800/dzGXyiQqcuh#us_core_v800/requirements) created by [Inferno](https://inferno.healthit.gov/) and their open-source testing framework to support the ONC Health IT Certification Program. This data is also available as a [CSV](#.md) or [EXCEL](#.md) file, and as a [US Core Server Requirements Resource](Requirements-server-requirements.md) and [US Core Client Requirements Resource](Requirements-client-requirements.md)

**Legend:**

* **ID:** A requirement key that identifies the requirement and links it to the statement in the guide.
* **Context:** The page or section topic that pertains to the requirement, For example, **US Core Medication Request Profile**, or **Clinical Notes**.
* **Actor:** The roles to which this requirement applies. The actors are: 
* Server: US Core Responder (Servers including Certifying Systems)
* Client: US Core Requester (Clients including Certifying Systems)
* Both: Both US Core Responder and Requester (including Certifying System).
 
* **Certifying Systems Only:** A Flag to indicate whether the requirement is an additional USCDI certification requirement.
* **Conformance:** The conformance verb of the requirement: SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, SHOULD-NOT, SHALL NOT, and DEPRECATED*. Note that there may be several conformance verbs in a single statement.
* **Requirement:** The actual requirements statement which is a direct quote from the IG and may include helpful context in square brackets.


  *If a requirement is removed for some reason, its ID is retired and its Conformance is updated to DEPRECATED.
